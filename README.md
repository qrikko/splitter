# Features
- *speedrun.com integration* - Most information of runs are fetched from speedrun.com
- *Split creation interface* - Familiar tools to set up splits heavily influenced by livesplit
- *Visual feedback* - Letting you (and your **viewers**) have a great overview of what is going on in the run
- *Animated run progress* - at the moment there is megaman running, but it is possible to to change animation, there is work being done to make an easy to use interface to set up your own animations
- *Pause splits* - If you mark a split as a pause split you can make the timer pause when reaching this split. Useful for example when doing no-reset practice. Personally I use it together with the limerick-practice ^^
- *Limerick mode* - In the limerick mode the splits are hidden, and revieled as the run progress. I started doing this as a fun way of doing practice where I want to run the same stage, passage or game over and over for practice. To make it a bit more interesing I wrote limericks instead of just "1, 2, 3" and to engage the audience I thought it could be fun if a limerick was revieled during the run.
